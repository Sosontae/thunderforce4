# Thunder Force IV - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sprite Display Issues
- **Problem**: Enemies were blinking and displayed vertically, player had no animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Corrected sprite dimensions (ship.png is 80x48, not 80x24)
  - Fixed animation frame counts (2 frames for enemies, not 6)
  - Removed `flipY: true` that was making sprites appear upside down
  - Slowed down animation speed to prevent blinking

### 2. Player Animation
- **Problem**: Player sprite showed no banking animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented proper banking animation based on vertical movement
  - 5 frames: extreme up, slight up, center, slight down, extreme down
  - Smooth transitions based on velocity

### 3. Power-up Icons
- **Problem**: Shield, speed, and life icons were missing
- **Solution**: 
  - power-up.png is a single 32x32 sprite, not a sprite sheet
  - Implemented icon text overlay system with proper colors
  - Added all 5 power-up types with distinct icons

### 4. Boss Animation
- **Problem**: Boss sprites had no animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Added pulsing scale effect
  - Rotating shield effect with dashed lines
  - Energy core glow effect
  - Dynamic shadow blur

### 5. Enemy Variety
- **Problem**: Limited enemy types
- **Solution**: Added 5 new enemy types:
  - **Scout**: Fast, weak, single shots
  - **Fighter**: Medium, double shots
  - **Bomber**: Slow, heavy, drops bombs
  - **Interceptor**: Rotating saucer with homing missiles
  - **Elite**: Powerful with fan shot pattern

### 6. Level Restart
- **Problem**: Game over screen instead of level restart
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed gameOver() to restart current level after 2 seconds
  - Shows "LEVEL FAILED - RESTARTING..." message
  - Player gets full lives on restart
