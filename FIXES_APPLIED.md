# Thunder Force IV - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sprite Display Issues
- **Problem**: Enemies were blinking and displayed vertically, player had no animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Corrected sprite dimensions (ship.png is 80x48, not 80x24)
  - Fixed animation frame counts (2 frames for enemies, not 6)
  - Removed `flipY: true` that was making sprites appear upside down
  - Slowed down animation speed to prevent blinking

### 2. Sprite Sheet Extraction
- **Problem**: Entire sprite sheets were being displayed instead of individual frames
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed `drawSprite` method to properly use source rectangle parameters
  - Updated all entities to calculate frameX position based on frame number
  - Removed broken `drawAnimatedSprite` calls in favor of proper `drawSprite` with frame parameters
  - Added proper source rectangle extraction: `drawImage(sprite, frameX, frameY, frameWidth, frameHeight, ...)`

### 3. Player Animation
- **Problem**: Player sprite showed no banking animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented proper banking animation based on vertical movement
  - 5 frames: extreme up, slight up, center, slight down, extreme down
  - Smooth transitions based on velocity
  - Calculate frameX as `frame * frameWidth` for proper extraction

### 4. Power-up Icons
- **Problem**: Shield, speed, and life icons were missing
- **Solution**: 
  - power-up.png is a single 32x32 sprite, not a sprite sheet
  - Implemented icon text overlay system with proper colors
  - Added all 5 power-up types with distinct icons
  - Added rotation animation to power-ups

### 5. Boss Animation
- **Problem**: Boss sprites had no animation
- **Solution**: 
  - Added pulsing scale effect
  - Rotating shield effect with dashed lines
  - Energy core glow effect
  - Dynamic shadow blur

### 6. Enemy Variety
- **Problem**: Limited enemy types
- **Solution**: Added 5 new enemy types:
  - **Scout**: Fast, weak, single shots
  - **Fighter**: Medium, double shots
  - **Bomber**: Slow, heavy, drops bombs
  - **Interceptor**: Rotating saucer with homing missiles
  - **Elite**: Powerful with fan shot pattern

### 7. Level Restart
- **Problem**: Game over screen instead of level restart
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed gameOver() to restart current level after 2 seconds
  - Shows "LEVEL FAILED - RESTARTING..." message
  - Player gets full lives on restart

### 8. Explosion Animation
- **Problem**: No sprite-based explosions
- **Solution**:
  - Added sprite sheet support for explosions (80x16 with 5 frames)
  - Calculate frame based on animation progress
  - Scale explosion sprite based on explosion size
  - Fallback to particle system if sprites not loaded

## New Features Added

### Enemy Attack Patterns
- Double shot (Fighter)
- Bomb drop (Bomber)
- Homing missiles (Interceptor)
- Fan pattern (Elite)

### Visual Improvements
- Proper sprite scaling for each enemy type
- Glow effects for elite enemies and bosses
- Smooth animation timing
- Rotating effects for interceptors
- Sprite-based explosions

### Difficulty Scaling
- Enemy health scales with level
- Enemy speed increases per level
- More enemy variety in spawn patterns

## Sprite Assets Used
- **Player**: 80x48 sprite sheet with 5 frames (16x48 each)
- **Small Enemy**: 32x16 sprite sheet with 2 frames (16x16 each)
- **Medium Enemy**: 64x16 sprite sheet with 2 frames (32x16 each)
- **Big Enemy**: 64x32 sprite sheet with 2 frames (32x32 each)
- **Explosion**: 80x16 sprite sheet with 5 frames (16x16 each)
- **Saucer**: Single sprite (rotating)
- **Void Ship**: Single sprite (elite enemy)
- **Biomech**: Single sprite (boss)
- **Power-up**: Single 32x32 sprite with text overlay

## Technical Details

### Sprite Drawing Method
```javascript
ctx.drawImage(
    sprite,                                    // Image source
    frameX, frameY, frameWidth, frameHeight,   // Source rectangle
    -frameWidth/2, -frameHeight/2,             // Destination position (centered)
    frameWidth, frameHeight                    // Destination size
);
```

### Frame Calculation
```javascript
const frame = Math.floor(Date.now() / animationSpeed) % totalFrames;
const frameX = frame * frameWidth;
const frameY = 0; // For horizontal sprite sheets
```
